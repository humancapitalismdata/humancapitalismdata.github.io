            Human Capitalism would have a few core tenets:<br /><br />
            1. Humanity is more important than money.<br />
            2. The unit of an economy is each person, not each dollar.<br />
            3. Markets exist to serve our common goals and values.</p>

    <p>This site was inspired by the nineteenth chapter of Andrew Yang's book, "The War on Normal People." The nineteenth chapter is titled "Human Capitalism." 
        In the chapter Yang describes the shortcomings of our current form of institutional capitalism. He describes a new type of economy that is geared toward 
        maximizing human well-being and fulfillment, which he calls Human-Centered Capitalism, or Human Capitalism for short.

            There’s a saying in business that “what gets measured gets managed for.” We need to start measuring different things.</p>

    <p>Andrew Yang describes the shortcomings of our current measure of capitalism, GDP or Gross Domestic Product, 
        and lists a few measurements that government should adapt, which include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Median income and standard of living</li>
        <li>Levels of engagement with work and labor participation rate</li>
        <li>Health-adjusted life expectancy</li>
        <li>Childhood success rates</li>
        <li>Infant mortality</li>
        <li>Surveys of national well-being</li>
        <li>Average physical fitness and mental health</li>
        <li>Quality of infrastructure</li>
        <li>Proportion of elderly in quality care</li>
        <li>Human capital development and access to education</li>
        <li>Marriage rates and success</li>
        <li>Deaths of despair/despair index/substance abuse</li>
        <li>National optimism/mindset of abundance</li>
        <li>Community integrity and social capital</li>
        <li>Environmental quality</li>
        <li>Global temperature variance and sea levels</li>
        <li>Reacclimation of incarcerated individuals and rates of criminality</li>
        <li>Artistic and cultural vibrancy</li>
        <li>Design and aesthetics</li>
        <li>Information integrity/journalism</li>
        <li>Dynamism and mobility</li>
        <li>Social and economic equity</li>
        <li>Public safety</li>
        <li>Civic engagement</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity</li>
        <li>Economic competitiveness and growth</li>
        <li>Responsiveness and evolution of government</li>
        <li>Efficient use of resources</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many of these measurements are already publicly available. With my background in data I decided to create this site wrangle some of this data and perhaps build some visualizations and infographics to make sense of these measurements.</p>
