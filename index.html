<p>The goal of this site is to provide a repository of cleaned public data for measurements of the health of the United States economy. It was inspired by Andrew Yang's book "The War on Normal People."</p>

<p>The site is hosted on GitHub pages as a public repository so all the data and code is freely available.<br />
