title: Median Income to Start
author: Mike

The first dataset I'm adding to the site is median income. It's available at the US census site, but the data is provided in Excel spreadsheets that need to be cleaned up. I'm trying to decide whether to clean it up and save it as JSON or CSV, though I'm leaning towards CSV at this point since it's probably more accessible to the general public in that format.

The plan is to clean it up and add it to the site using the <a href="https://www.datatables.net/">DataTables</a> jQuery plugin. In the future I also plan to add visualizations, either using ChartJS or D3.
