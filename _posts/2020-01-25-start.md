So it took a bit more work than I thought it would, but the site is up on GitHub pages. Most of the initial time was spent figuring out how to get Jekyll working on my local machine, figuring out which editor I wanted to use (turns out VS Code that I already use works fine), and figuring out how data works in Jekyll. 

Now that I have all that figured out I'm finding that Jekyll + Github pages is a great combination for this site. The fact that it's on a public Github repository invites collaboration and also invites the public to download and find uses for the cleaned data I hope to be using for this site.
